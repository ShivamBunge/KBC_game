The project contains only 4 sample questions currently defined in the 'Questions(i)' function along with their options.

Their correct answers need to be retuned from the 'correct_ans(i)' function. 

On pressing the lifelines button the images get modified to 'used lifeline' image but there is no functionality added to them 
as such (like sound, original audience poll, eliminating 2 options, etc)

On clicking incorrect answers only an image is displayed, more functionality is to be added like final amount won, decorations can be added.

After passing each question the Millionaire image gets updated (in ABC2 frame) on the right hand side ,decorations can be added for appreciation,
congratulating the user ,etc.

Sounds are to be added yet.
